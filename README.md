# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in various programming languages. It serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and working with essential data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.

## Features
- Implementations in programming languages (e.g., Java, C++)
- Clear and efficient algorithms for common data structures
- Code examples with comments to explain the logic and usage
- Organized into categories for easy navigation (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.)

## Data Structures Covered:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Tries
- And more...

## How to Use
Each data structure has its own directory, which contains the implementation and relevant algorithms. You can clone the repository and run the code for each data structure independently. Make sure to check the comments within the code for explanations and usage instructions.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shraya05/Data-Structures.git
